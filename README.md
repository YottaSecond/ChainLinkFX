An application for realtime guitar FX... or other inputs, I guess!

Initial plan is to use portaudio for the audio backend to be... portable?

C for audio processing, javax.swing for GUI, maayyybeeee some XML for saving/loading configurations, maaaaaaayyyyyyyybeeeeeeee Arduino for control.

If you're reading this and there's actually usable code here, do whatever you want with it!
